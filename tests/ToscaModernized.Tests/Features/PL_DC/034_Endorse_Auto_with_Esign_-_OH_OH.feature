Feature: Execute Endorse Auto with Esign - OH for one representative PL|DC iteration
  As a PL|DC policy processing user
  I want to complete the Endorse Auto with Esign - OH workflow for the selected source iteration
  So that every source-defined action, test datum, runtime dependency, and expected result is preserved in sequence


  Background: Establish the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context
    Given the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context and source-defined prerequisites are initialized

  Scenario: Endorse Auto with Esign - OH using representative iteration Ohio (OH)
