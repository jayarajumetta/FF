Feature: Execute Endorse Auto with Esign - PA for one representative PL|DC iteration
  As a PL|DC policy processing user
  I want to complete the Endorse Auto with Esign - PA workflow for the selected source iteration

  Background: Establish the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context
    Given the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context and source-defined prerequisites are initialized

  Scenario: Endorse Auto with Esign - PA using representative iteration Pennsylvania (PA)
