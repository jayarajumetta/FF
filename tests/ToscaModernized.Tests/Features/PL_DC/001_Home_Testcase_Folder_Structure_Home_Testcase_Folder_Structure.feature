Feature: Execute Home Testcase Folder Structure for one representative PL|DC iteration
  As a PL|DC policy processing user
  I want to complete the Home Testcase Folder Structure workflow for the selected source iteration
  So that every source-defined action, test datum, runtime dependency, and expected result is preserved in sequence


  Background: Establish the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context
    Given the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context and source-defined prerequisites are initialized

  Scenario: Home Testcase Folder Structure using representative iteration Home Testcase Folder Structure
    # Source step 0027: Set LOB & State | Module: TBox Set Buffer
    # Section: Postcondition > Set LOB & State | Reusable flow: Home & Auto |13 EQ |  Premium Validation(Actual vs Expected) in Pre-Policy | Source XTestStep: 3a19dd55-d3da-f721-3841-73fc357c3af1
    Given I retain hard-coded value "Home" as runtime value "LOB"
    When I retain hard-coded value "NM" as runtime value "State"

    # Source step 0037: TestData - Find & provide item from TDM | Module: Old_TestData - Find & provide item
    # Section: Postcondition > 02 Premium Validation | Reusable flow: Home & Auto |13 EQ |  Premium Validation(Actual vs Expected) in Pre-Policy | Source XTestStep: 3a19dd55-d3e9-1615-20d6-0f44272a1688
    When I retrieve test data through TDM operation "TestData - Find & provide item from TDM"
    And I use TDM parameter "Existing TDS type" with "PremiumValidation_Reference"
    And I use TDM parameter "Data search filter > TCName" with captured runtime value "TCName"
    And I use TDM parameter "Data search filter > State" with captured runtime value "State"
    And I use TDM parameter "Data search filter > LOB" with captured runtime value "LOB"

    # Source step 0038: Get Validated Premium from TDM | Module: TBox Set Buffer
    # Section: Postcondition > 02 Premium Validation | Reusable flow: Home & Auto |13 EQ |  Premium Validation(Actual vs Expected) in Pre-Policy | Source XTestStep: 3a19dd55-d3e9-15e0-22f5-124c3e13f033
    When I retrieve and retain the RUNTIME-DERIVED TDM value "PremiumValidation_Reference.ValidatedPremium" as runtime value "Expected_ValidatedPremium"

    # Source step 0039:  Compare Actual Premium vs Expected Premium | Module: TBox Set Buffer
    # Section: Postcondition > 02 Premium Validation | Reusable flow: Home & Auto |13 EQ |  Premium Validation(Actual vs Expected) in Pre-Policy | Source XTestStep: 3a19dd55-d3e9-2c68-4316-e800a7c0cf60
    When I perform the source-defined buffer operation "Compare Actual Premium vs Expected Premium"

    # Source step 0040: Log Out- Exist from the Quote/Policy | Module: EQ||Log Out
    # Section: Postcondition | Reusable flow: <none> | Source XTestStep: 3a19e1e5-3d6d-2f20-8208-234a536e33d8
    When I click "Btn_Log Out icon"
    When I click "Btn_Log Out pop-up"

    # Source step 0041: CloseBrowser | Module: CloseBrowser
    # Section: Postcondition | Reusable flow: <none> | Source XTestStep: 3a19e1e5-3d6d-8eb9-f2b0-76cf1560db02
    When I close the active browser
