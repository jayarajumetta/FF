Feature: Execute Activity Points - Major Conviction (Auto) - NY for one representative PL|DC iteration
  As a PL|DC policy processing user
  I want to complete the Activity Points - Major Conviction (Auto) - NY workflow for the selected source iteration
  So that every source-defined action, test datum, runtime dependency, and expected result is preserved in sequence


  Background: Establish the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context
    Given the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context and source-defined prerequisites are initialized

  Scenario: Activity Points - Major Conviction (Auto) - NY using representative iteration Activity Points - Major Conviction (Auto) - NY
