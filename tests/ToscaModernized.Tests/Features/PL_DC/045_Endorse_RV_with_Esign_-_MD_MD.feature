Feature: Execute Endorse RV with Esign - MD for one representative PL|DC iteration
  As a PL|DC policy processing user
  I want to complete the Endorse RV with Esign - MD workflow for the selected source iteration
  So that every source-defined action, test datum, runtime dependency, and expected result is preserved in sequence


  Background: Establish the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context
    Given the Personal Lines Duck Creek application context and source-defined prerequisites are initialized

  Scenario: Endorse RV with Esign - MD using representative iteration Maryland (MD)
